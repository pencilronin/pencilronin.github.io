<p> Vincenzo Alexander was born in a hot, foul place populated with lizards and palm trees. The lizards were cool. He has inhabited many places since; 4 states, multiple cities and rural locations, and the A train. He plays with mold making, Arduino, and experimenting with various types of clay. He loves and is inspired by Designer Toys, sci fi and fantasy, special effects creatures, Halloween, the extravagance of the Rococo era, Japanese culture, chameleons, very bright colors, and a hoard of other things. His favorite snack is taro milk buns, daifuku and taro bubble tea.
